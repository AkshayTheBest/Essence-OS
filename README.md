# Essence-OS

Essence OS - Windows For Every Gamer 
Is the stripped, lightweight version of Windows that can be used for every gamer in any PC.

# About this Repositary

This repositary is used to give out all the files and settings used for every version of Essence OS's base so you can copy it if you want to make your own Essence OS-ish OS (make sure to give me credit though). It will start from the 3.0 version of Essence OS (Windows 10). 

This repositary will NOT include all the files that I use as its a secret from my own OS but you can take these files into NTLite and create your own BASE of Essence OS.

Every release will come 1-2 weeks later after the debut of that version on YouTube. So check out the OS regularly and make your own after if you want the latest only.

(There is currently no releases yet but it will come soon.)

# Legal?

First of all, all rights are reserved to Microsoft for their operation system Windows. I do not intend to take/steal any profits from them. I only modified or rebuilt into a really really stripped version of their OS. Even thought its illegal in their terms and condition to redistribute Windows Copies to other in public, I do have a verification from the Community Posts of NTLite (the app I used to create the base of this OS) where I asked a moderator about my OS if its illegal or not and I gave my consent, gave all my files that I use for the OS and he approved it. So, I will be using that post as my verification approval.
